# Diabetes Feature Engineering

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`diabetes-feature-engineering (3).ipynb`) that demonstrates feature engineering techniques applied to a diabetes dataset. The goal is to prepare the data for machine learning models by creating informative features that can improve prediction performance.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following key aspects:

-   **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loading the diabetes dataset and performing initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure, distributions, and potential issues.
-   **Outlier Analysis and Handling:** Identifying and addressing outliers in the numerical features to ensure data quality and model robustness.
-   **Missing Value Imputation:** Handling missing values using appropriate imputation techniques, such as mean or median imputation.
-   **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features based on existing ones to capture relevant patterns and relationships. This includes:
    -      Creating categorical features from numerical ones.
    -      Generating interaction features.
    -   Creating new features based on domain knowledge.
-   **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Transforming categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models using techniques like one-hot encoding.
-   **Feature Scaling:** Scaling numerical features to a common range to prevent features with larger magnitudes from dominating the model.
-   **Data Preparation for Modeling:** Preparing the final dataset for machine learning by selecting relevant features and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
